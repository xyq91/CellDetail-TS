# CellDetail
<strong> CellDetail </strong> (<strong>Cell</strong> <strong>Det</strong>ection and <strong>A</strong>nalysis of <strong>I</strong>ntensity <strong>L</strong>ounge) is a free GUI software based on Matlab code. It was designed to quantify the spatial distribution of components in single cells. The algorithm for polarity quantification is based on the concept of the physical quantity dipole moment.

IF image stacks or single cell layers (tiff files) of single cells are used as input.
Furthermore, cell detection is included in CellDetail. Another possibility is to use externally derived cell-background masks.

Output: 
Polarity quantification parameter P_n (absolute value of normalized dipole moment), volume, diameter, average intensity, total intensity, positive and negative charge centers, center of the cell, Pearson correlation coefficient (co-localization), ...
